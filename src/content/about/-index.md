## 👨‍💻 About Me

<div class="text-left">

Hey! I’m **Andrés Retamal López**, a **.NET Software Engineer** currently living in **Zürich, Switzerland** 🇨🇭  
I moved here about **7 months ago**, chasing new opportunities, personal growth, and a fresh start.  
It’s been a journey full of learning — new country, new language (yep, I’m learning German 🇩🇪), and a whole new level of independence.  

What I love most about Zürich is how it mixes nature and city life — forests right in the middle of the city, respectful people, and a sense of calm everywhere.  
It’s a place that constantly reminds me to improve and enjoy the process while working toward my goals.  

At the moment, I’m focused on finding a full-time position where I can do what I love most:  
**building scalable, reliable systems with .NET and Azure**.  
I’ve spent the last **5+ years** working across **banking, energy, and hospitality**, designing and delivering end-to-end solutions using **.NET 9, ASP.NET Core, Blazor, EF Core**, and **Azure Cloud**.

I care a lot about **clean, maintainable code** — I’m big on **planning, structure, and documentation**, and I take pride in delivering software that’s solid and elegant.  
I’d describe myself as **organized, perfectionist, and curious** — always exploring new technologies, frameworks, and better ways to code.
