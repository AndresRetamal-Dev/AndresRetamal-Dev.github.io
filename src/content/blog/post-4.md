Before any code exists — before the first endpoint, before the first database table, before the system architecture even takes shape — there is a crucial phase that determines whether a project will succeed or collapse under its own confusion.

In my case, I wasn’t just a participant in this phase.
I led it completely, de principio a fin.

This article explains how I became the bridge between the client and the engineering team, managing the full pre-development workflow on my own:

- Requirements gathering
- Communication with the client’s stakeholders
- Alignment with my manager
- Coordination between my company and the client’s company
- Writing briefs
- Creating documentation
- Validating flows, constraints and expectations
- Converting business ideas into technical tasks
- Preparing the entire project structure before development started

I handled all of this solo before the developers even touched the keyboard.
And this is important because this part of the job is often invisible, but it’s where real engineering begins.

It’s the moment where ideas become structure.
Where confusion becomes clarity.
Where “we need this” becomes “we can build this”.

In the next sections, I’ll break down every step of the process I personally carried out:

🗣️ Communication & requirement gathering.
📝 Documentation (Confluence, Azure)
📌 Task organisation & workflow (Jira)
🤝 Coordination between teams
✔️ Validation & approval
🧱 Preparing the project foundation for developers

This is the real story of what happens before the first line of code —
and how taking ownership of that phase shaped the success of the entire project.


### 🗣️ 2. Communication & Requirement Gathering — Where Everything Starts

Before documentation exists, before Jira tickets are created, before any architectural decision is made, the very first step is communication.
Understanding the client’s needs, expectations, limitations, and business goals is what shapes the entire project.

And in this phase, I wasn’t just involved — I was responsible for all of it.

I acted as the direct link between the client, my manager, my company, and the engineering team.
This meant gathering information, clarifying requirements, asking the right questions, and making sure everyone shared the same understanding.

### 💬 2.1 Initial Meetings With the Client

The process always began with a series of meetings involving:

- Client stakeholders
- Business representatives
- Product owners
- Technical contacts on the client’s side
- My own manager
- My role was to extract two key things:

### ✔️ 1. The “WHAT”

- What does the client need?
- What does the feature do?
- What problem does it solve?
- What business value does it bring?

### ✔️ 2. The “WHY” Behind It

Clients often request something without fully understanding the technical implications or possible alternatives.
My responsibility was to analyse, translate, challenge when necessary, and refine.

### 🧠 2.2 Turning Conversations Into Actual Requirements

From each meeting, I collected every detail — but the important part was transforming all this information into structured, actionable requirements:

- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements
- System limitations
- Dependencies between teams
- Security considerations
- Performance expectations
- Deadlines or business commitments

This is where I started shaping the skeleton of the project.

### 🤝 2.3 My Role as the Bridge Between Worlds

At this stage, I connected all parties:

👉 Client ↔ My company
👉 Client ↔ My manager
👉 Client ↔ Engineering team
👉 Client ↔ Architecture/Integrations

The workflow was constant:

- The client explained a need
- I validated whether it made technical sense
- I aligned it with my manager
- I refined the idea
- I confirmed it back with the client
- I created the documentation
- I prepared it for the development team

In other words:
I ensured that everyone was speaking the same language.

### 📌 2.4 Eliminating Ambiguities (The Most Crucial Part)

One of the biggest risks in software projects is unclear requirements.
To avoid misunderstandings, I focused on eliminating:

Ambiguous definitions
Incomplete scenarios
Conflicting ideas
Assumptions
Missing edge cases
Undefined responsibilities

I asked questions like:

- “What should happen if the payment fails?”
- “What does the end user need to see?”
- “How should we behave if the external provider doesn’t respond?”
- “What deadlines must we respect?”
- “Who approves this flow?”
- “Are there internal rules the system must follow?”

This investigative work ensured nothing was built on vague or contradictory information.

🧩 Summary of This Phase

During Communication & Requirement Gathering, I:

- Led all initial conversations
- Translated vague business ideas into precise technical requirements
- Clarified complex doubts
- Organized scattered information
- Acted as the communication bridge between business and engineering
- Built the foundation of the project before the first line of code


### 📝 3. Documentation — Turning Information Into a Structured Project

Once the requirements were clear, my next responsibility was to turn all that raw information into organized, accessible documentation.
This is the moment where the project stops being ideas and becomes something real and structured.

And again — I handled this entire phase myself.

### 📚 3.1 Confluence: Building the Knowledge Base

I created all the project documentation in Confluence, including:

- Project overview (scope, business goals, context)
- Functional documentation (flows, behaviours, edge cases)
- Technical notes (diagrams, sequences, integrations)
- Requirements checklist (approvals, missing pieces, validations)
- Everything was written clearly so both the client and the engineering team could understand the project instantly.

### 🧩 3.2 Briefs for Faster Validation

Before writing Jira tasks, I created briefs summarizing each feature:

- What the client needs
- Why it matters
- High-level flow
- Dependencies
- Links to detailed documentation

These briefs helped:

- The client validate quickly
- My manager align priorities
- The dev team understand the feature in one look

### 📃 3.3 Syncing With Client Tools & Azure Docs

Some clients had internal tools for feature requests and bugs.
I kept everything synchronized between:

- Client platform
- Jira
- Confluence
- And for Azure-related parts, I documented:
- Endpoints
- Cloud resources
- Configurations
- Deployment considerations

### 🧠 3.4 Why This Step Matters

This phase created a single source of truth.
By the end, every idea was transformed into:

- Clear documentation
- Approved requirements
- Ready-to-build instructions

The team could start coding with full clarity — because I had already structured everything upfront.

### 📌 4. Task Organisation — Turning Requirements Into Actionable Work (Jira)

Once the documentation was complete, my next step was to turn everything into actionable tasks so the development team could start working with clarity and direction.
All the task organisation in Jira — from epics to subtasks — was handled by me.

### 🧱 4.1 Structuring the Work in Jira

I transformed the documented requirements into a clean, logical structure:

Epics → big functional blocks
User Stories → specific behaviours or flows
Subtasks → technical actions for developers

Each task included:

Clear title
Summary of the goal
Acceptance criteria
Technical notes
Links to Confluence documentation

### 🎯 4.2 Prioritisation & Planning

I aligned priorities with:

The client
My manager
Internal deadlines
Dependencies with other teams

This ensured the roadmap was realistic and aligned with business expectations.

### 🤝 4.3 Preparing Everything for the Dev Team

Before developers started, I ensured every task had:

No ambiguity
All edge cases covered
Clear “Definition of Done”
Verified requirements
Links to diagrams, briefs, and flows

This prevented blockers and eliminated guesswork later.

### 🧠 4.4 Why This Step Was Important

Good task organisation transforms a chaotic project into a predictable, buildable plan.
By the time the team started coding, everything was:

Prioritised
Structured
Documented
Fully aligned

Because I had already prepared the entire foundation.
