![Workflow Diagram](/images/Diagram4_01.png)

Before any endpoint exists and before any architecture takes shape, there is a phase that determines whether a project will succeed or fail. It is a phase that usually stays invisible, but it is where real engineering actually begins.

In my case, I was not just part of that phase.
I owned it completely, from start to finish.

This article explains how I acted as the bridge between the client, my company and the engineering team, transforming a vague business request into a fully structured, ready-to-build technical plan.

## 📊 The Complete Workflow 

![Workflow Diagram](/images/Diagrama2.png)


## 1️⃣ First Meeting – Defining Needs and Goals

![Workflow Diagram](/images/Diagram5.png)

Everything starts with a meeting between:

- The client
- My manager
- Myself

The objective is simple but critical: understand what the client wants and why they want it.

✔️ What

- What problem needs to be solved?
- What feature is expected?
- What business value does it bring?

✔️ Why

The reasoning behind the request, which is often incomplete or unclear and must be uncovered.

This stage builds the foundation for everything that follows.

## 2️⃣ Requirement Gathering – Turning Conversations Into Clarity

![Workflow Diagram](/images/Diagram6.png)

After the initial meeting, I coordinated directly with:

- Client stakeholders
- Business and product owners
- Technical contacts
- My manager
- Architecture and integrations teams

My responsibility was to extract and structure all relevant information:

- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements
- Limitations and dependencies
- Security considerations
- Edge cases
- Performance expectations
- Deadlines

I constantly asked questions that eliminate ambiguity:

- What happens if this fails?
- How should the system behave in this case?
- Who approves this flow?
- What rules must we respect?

This is where ideas start transforming into real structure.

## 3️⃣ Technical Analysis – Validating What Is Possible

Once the requirements are clear, I review everything from a technical point of view:

- Existing code
- Current integrations
- System limitations
- Scalability
- Technical alternatives
- Time and cost impact

The goal is to validate whether the request is feasible and determine the best technical approach.

## 4️⃣ Briefing and Documentation – Creating the Single Source of Truth

With enough clarity, I prepare all documentation myself.

##### 📄 Business and technical briefs

Simple summaries used by managers and business teams to validate:

- What will be built
- Why this approach is chosen
- Key constraints
- Time implications

## 📚 Confluence documentation

This is where the full detail lives:

- Functional flows
- Behaviours and rules
- Diagrams
- Edge cases
- Requirements checklist
- Any technical considerations

### 🔄 Sync with Jira, client systems and Azure documentation

All platforms reflect the same information.

By the end of this phase, everyone shares the same understanding.

## 5️⃣ Client Review Meeting – Presenting the Solution

![Workflow Diagram](/images/Diagram9.png)

Once documentation is ready, I lead a session with:

- Client business team
- Client technical team
- My manager and leadership

I explain the solution, its benefits, limitations, timeline and required efforts.

This is where the client validates the direction or requests adjustments.

## 6️⃣ Budget Definition – Final Approval

![Workflow Diagram](/images/Diagram10.png)

With the approach validated, we calculate:

- Development hours
- Systems hours
- Final budget

If the client approves, the project moves forward.
If not, I refine the proposal and restart the cycle if necessary.

## 7️⃣ Task Organisation – Preparing Development for Success

![Workflow Diagram](/images/Diagram11.png)

Once approved, I structure all work in Jira:

- Epics
- User stories
- Subtasks

Each item includes:

- Clear goals
- Acceptance criteria
- Links to documentation
- Diagrams
- Edge cases
- “Definition of Done”

When the developers begin, there are no questions or uncertainties.

## 8️⃣ Development Phase – Coding Begins with Full Clarity

![Workflow Diagram](/images/Diagram12.png)

Only at this point do developers start building the solution.

Because everything was prepared upfront, development becomes:

- Predictable
- Efficient
- Free of blockers
- Fully aligned

## 9️⃣ Continuous Documentation – Keeping Everything Updated

![Workflow Diagram](/images/Diagram13.png)

During implementation, I update:

- Confluence
- Jira
- Azure documentation

This ensures the entire team always operates with the latest information.

🚀 Why This Workflow Matters

Most people think engineering starts when you begin coding.

It does not.

It starts with:

- Communication
- Understanding
- Planning
- Analysing
- Documenting
- Validating

This invisible phase is what makes the real engineering possible.

And in this project, I led that entire phase end to end.

##### 🚀 Final Thoughts — Engineering Starts Long Before Coding

Most engineers think their job begins when they open the IDE.

But the real engineering happens long before anyone writes a single line of code.

It happens when you: 
- Extract clarity from chaos,
- Transform vague ideas into structured plans,
- Prevent future blockers before they appear and align everyone around the same vision.

This invisible phase is not just preparation, it is the foundation that makes professional engineering possible and mastering it is what turns an engineer into a true end-to-end leader.


#####  🚀 Key Takeaways — What This Workflow Really Delivers

- Clarity before action: The fastest way to deliver is to understand the problem deeply before touching the IDE.

- Engineering starts early: Real engineering is communication, alignment, analysis, planning, not only coding.

- Documentation removes chaos: A clear functional and technical pack eliminates blockers, confusion, and rework.

- Alignment multiplies productivity: When everyone shares the same understanding, development becomes predictable and efficient.

- Preparation is leadership: Owning the entire pre-development phase is what transforms an engineer into an end-to-end leader.
